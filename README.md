## Potential Projects

1. Quantum Circuit Basics
Create simple quantum circuits: Start by creating basic circuits using qubits and gates like Hadamard, Pauli-X, and CNOT gates.
Superposition: Use the Hadamard gate to place a qubit in superposition and visualize the outcome on a Bloch sphere.
Entanglement: Create an entangled state using two qubits (e.g., using a Hadamard and CNOT gate) and observe how measuring one qubit affects the other.
2. Quantum Measurement
Run a circuit and measure: Construct a simple circuit, measure the qubits, and analyze the probabilities of outcomes. For example, measure a qubit in superposition to observe different measurement probabilities.
3. Quantum Algorithms
Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm: Implement this algorithm to determine whether a given function is constant or balanced with a single quantum query.
Grover's Algorithm: Implement Grover’s search algorithm, which finds the marked item in an unsorted database much faster than classical methods.
4. Quantum Teleportation
Simulate quantum teleportation: Set up a circuit that demonstrates quantum teleportation, where the state of one qubit is transmitted to another qubit via entanglement.
5. Random Number Generation
Quantum random number generation: Use quantum superposition and measurement to generate truly random numbers, unlike classical pseudo-random generators.
6. Quantum Fourier Transform
Implement Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT): Explore how to decompose a state into its frequency components, which is a key operation in many quantum algorithms, like Shor's algorithm.
7. Simulating Molecules (Quantum Chemistry)
Simple molecular simulations: Use Qiskit’s chemistry module to simulate small molecules like H₂. You can calculate ground-state energies and see the power of quantum computers for chemistry.
8. Basic Optimization Problems
Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA): Implement QAOA to solve simple combinatorial optimization problems such as Max-Cut on a graph.
